# My Blockchain Learning Journey

### Welcome! This repository serves as a living document of my journey into the world of blockchain development. Here, I'll be sharing my code, notes, and insights as I explore the core concepts of this exciting technology.

### My goal is to build a strong, hands-on foundation, progressing from the fundamentals of Solidity and smart contracts to building functional decentralized applications (dApps). Feel free to follow along as I learn and build in public.

# Daily Logs:
## Day 0 : (September-28):  
### What i Learned Today:  
Blockchain, Smart Contracts, Decentralization, Ethereum, Oracle Problem, Hybrid Smart Contracts, Chainlink, Transparency, Immutable, Metamask, Faucet, Etherscan, Gas, Kaccak256, Hash, Mining, Keys, Digital Signature, Bitcoin, Transactions.

#### Blockchain: 
Immutable, decentralized, Transparent Ledger  

#### Decentralized: 
Everything is not maintained by a single Central Authority , Instead everything is spread across the nodes all around  

#### Smart Contracts: 
Set of instructions, followed by execution in decentralized way, withoud needing any centralized or 3rd party  

#### Oracle Problem: 
Due to External Data  

#### Blockchain oracle: 
it enables smart contracts to execute inputs and outputs from real world  

#### Ethereum: 
A blockchain platform  

#### Hybrid Smart Contracts: 
on chain and off chain both , combined using oracles like chainlink  

#### Metamask: 
a browser extension that acts as a wallet  

#### Faucet: 
a platform that provides free currency to developers so they can freely experiment without paying  

#### Etherscan: 
used to see transactions and wallet info using account address  

#### Gas: 
fee required to proceed a transaction  

#### Hash: 
a string of fixed length represents a data, ethereum uses the keccak256 hashing algo  


## Day 1 : (September 29): 
### What i learned today: 
Resiliens, Consensus, Chain selection, Sybil Resistance, Proof of work , Proof of Stack, Nakamato Consensus, longest Chain rule, Sybil attack, 51% attack, Validators, Scalability, Sharding, Nodes, Layer, Rollups.
