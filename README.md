# My Blockchain Learning Journey

### Welcome! This repository serves as a living document of my journey into the world of blockchain development. Here, I'll be sharing my code, notes, and insights as I explore the core concepts of this exciting technology.

### My goal is to build a strong, hands-on foundation, progressing from the fundamentals of Solidity and smart contracts to building functional decentralized applications (dApps). Feel free to follow along as I learn and build in public.
